Motif XF network audio
======================

Playback
--------

To play audio through the Motif, connect to it on TCP port 5556 and send a
continuous stream of audio chunks, each consisting of the eight bytes

  ‘W’, ‘A’, ‘V’, ‘E’, 0xLL, 0xHH, 0x00, 0x00

followed by 0xHHLL bytes of stereo, 16-bit, signed, little-endian audio
data. 0x8000 works well as a chunk size, and matches that used by the
instrument when recording.

The Motif has a playback buffer of size 0x180000 bytes, and will only start
playback once this buffer is full. If we close() the socket (or shutdown()
the sending side), it immediately dumps this buffer and stops playback.

Sample code is in motifplay.c. On normal exit, it pads the end of the
playback data with 0x180000 zero bytes and closes the socket immediately
afterwards. The result of this is that we play right up to the end of the
unpadded audio data and then stop cleanly: the instrument dumps only the
silent padding.

On SIGINT, however, the socket is closed without padding, so playback stops
promptly and buffered audio data is discarded.


Recording
---------

To record audio from the Motif, connect to it on TCP port 5555 and you will
receive a continuous stream of audio chunks, each consisting of the eight
bytes

  ‘W’, ‘A’, ‘V’, ‘E’, 0xLL, 0xHH, 0x00, 0x00

followed by 0xHHLL bytes of stereo, 16-bit, signed, little-endian audio
data. The instrument always uses a chunk size of 0x8000 when recording,
even though it seems to support other chunk sizes on playback.

Close the connection when you want to stop recording audio data. (This is
all the official Yamaha iPad app does.)

Sample code is in motifrecord.c. It continues recording until interrupted
with SIGINT. It then finishes recording and exits cleanly.
